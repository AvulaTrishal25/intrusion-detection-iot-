This project is about building a smart security system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system uses motion sensors (PIR sensors), a buzzer, and a mobile app called Blynk to detect if someone enters a space without permission.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
The motion sensor keeps watching for any movement.

If movement is detected, the system quickly does two things:

It sounds an alarm using a buzzer.

It sends an alert to the user's phone through the Blynk app.

Everything happens in real time, so the user knows immediately if something unusual is happening.
The system is controlled by a small computer (a microcontroller), which manages all the devices and makes sure they work together smoothly. A flowchart in the project shows the step-by-step process of how the system works.

What the project achieved:
All the parts (sensors, buzzer, app) were successfully connected and worked well together.
The system can be used in different places and is easy to expand or improve.
